                <p>My name is Bethan Jmaes, I am 25 years old from South West Wales and currently living in Manchester. I have recently started a bootcamp at the University with the hope to start a career in the tech industry as a web developer.</p>
                <p>How I got into web developing:</p>
                <p>In 2015 I moved to Eastern Canada and work at a ski resort in the ticket office. The resort were implementing a resort wide software to use in the hotel, ticket office and different food outlets. I was added to the team working on inputting all the data and going through the training to use the different aspects of the software.</p>  
                <p>As part of the package it aksi included a shell website that customer could book hotel stays, season passes and tickets, gift cards and book lessons. It was a very basic website that didnt come with a lot of style or customization. The company wanted to make changes to get the website to work they wanted, this is when we started looking at the code. I didnt understand what I was looking at but after watching the web developer I realised I had  an interest in the area.</p> 
                <p>Over the last 2 years I have been teaching myself using online sources until I started the bootcamp.</p>
